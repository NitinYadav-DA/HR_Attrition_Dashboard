    roles, educational backgrounds, and commuting distances. Through comprehensive data visualization and trend analysis, this dashboard aims to reveal patterns and correlations that can inform strategic 
    interventions to reduce turnover and enhance employee retention.

 # Key points and actionable insights for employee retention :

1) Focus on Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives:                                                                                                  
 • Implement targeted retention strategies for these roles, such as career development programs or improved compensation packages.                        
2) Address mid-career concerns:                                                                                                                              
 • The 26-35 age group shows highest attrition. Develop mid-career growth opportunities and work-life balance initiatives.                                  
3) Investigate gender disparity:                                                                                                                            
 • More males are leaving. Conduct surveys to understand gender-specific issues and address them.                                                          
4) Review travel policies:                                                                                                                                  
 • Those who travel rarely have high attrition. Consider if travel opportunities are equitably distributed or if they're causing dissatisfaction.            
5) Examine Sales department issues:                                                                                                                          
 • This department has the highest attrition. Investigate workload, management practices, and career progression opportunities.                              
6) Enhance retention for educated employees:                                                                                                                 
 • Many leavers have higher degrees. Ensure challenging work and growth opportunities for highly educated staff.                                            
7) Address work distance concerns:                                                                                                                        
 • A significant number leave due to distance. Consider flexible work arrangements or relocation assistance.                                                
8) Leverage low performers:                                                                                                                                  
 • Understand why low performers are staying and use this insight to improve overall retention.
